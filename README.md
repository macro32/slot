A Silly LOTtery program

OK. So I had a week off. For a few days it was too hot to paint, or do much else. I had time to think. Dangerous, or what?

For years I have dabbled with the lottery. Increasingly this has become an integral part of my retirement plans. 

The thing is, every week the numbers drawn have an equal chance of selection. Probability says so, I get it. But wouldn't it be nice if you could have a system which tipped the odds a bit in your favour?

Here's a thought. Although every week the numbers have the same chance of being picked, what if you look at the numbers over a series of weeks? Repeated numbers in consecutive weeks is not common. I did study probability and statistics at University, but this was over forty years ago. I vaguely remember there is something about the probability of independent events and sequences. I am probably (0.999) talking complete bollocks, of course? It isn't the first time, and it definitely won't be the last.

We also get different distributions of numbers. Sometimes they are evenly spread. Other times they can be bunched. Skewed low or high. Split low and high. There isn't any mathematical analysis applicable, but my observation is that you never get a single distribution pattern repeated indefinitely.

I will put something together to pick numbers on this basis. So my requirements are:

1. Pick how many duplicates you want
2. Pick the number distribution you want (picks can bunch, high or low, or be evenly distributed)
3. Pick how many weeks back you want to include.

Then randomly select numbers that fit the above criteria. Exclude numbers from previous weeks, except for the specified number of duplicates required, and apply the distribution specified.

Not sure what to write it in. I would like to keep my hand in. Same reason I do Countdown every day.
